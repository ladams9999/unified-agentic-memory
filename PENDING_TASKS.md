# Pending Tasks for unified-agentic-memory

## Deferred by design (v1 scope)

- **pg_cron scheduling policy** — `pg_cron` is installed and smoke-tested. Specific schedule cadence for the dream phase is intentionally deferred until real usage data is available.
- **Security hardening** — API has no authentication. Local single-user assumptions hold for v1. Add hardening before any remote or multi-user deployment.
- **Warp MCP integration** — Warp v1 uses skill + CLI only. MCP integration deferred.
- **Search/index tuning** — Cache TTL and RRF weights use default values. Tuning deferred until real data volume exists.
